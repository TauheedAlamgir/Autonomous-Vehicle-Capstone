# Autonomous Vehicle System
Capstone Project – Carleton University

Overview:
This project involved designing and implementing an autonomous vehicle capable of real-time navigation and localization using multiple sensors.  
The system was developed as part of the final-year capstone project and integrates LiDAR, IMU, and GNSS data to perform mapping, localization, and path tracking.

Features:
- Real-time sensor data acquisition and processing
- Localization using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)
- LiDAR-based environment mapping and obstacle detection
- GNSS–IMU sensor fusion for accurate position estimation
- ROS2-based communication between modules
- Simulation testing in Gazebo and Carla
- Integration with QGIS for map visualization


Tools & Technologies:
  ROS2 (Robot Operating System)  
  Python and C++  
  Gazebo and Carla simulators  
  QGIS for global map visualization  
  EKF/AMCL for sensor fusion and localization  

Team Contributions:
  - Tauheed Alamgir: Localization system integration using LiDAR and AMCL, LiDAR–IMU–GNSS data alignment, simulation setup in Carla and Gazebo, and final testing
